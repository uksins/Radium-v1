# 🌌 What Is Radium?

* Radium Aims To Become The Most Powerful Python Nuker, Coded By Napal And Sins
* Radium Uses Their Own Custom Library, To Bring A Powerful, Yet Lightweight Beautiful CLI

# 📌 Things To Note:

* Python 3.9 And Above Is Required To Run Radium
* For Any Errors, Join Discord.gg/radium

# ❓ How Can I Ensure Radium Is Safe?

* Radium Is Open-Source, (Hence Being On Github): If You Have Any Worries About Any Malicious Code, Check The Code For Yourself

# ❔ VirusTotal Flagged This As Malicious

* VirusTotal May Flag The Code As Malicious, As Handles Tokens, And Sends Requests To The Same Endpoints As Token Loggers:
* For Example: https://discord.com/api/v10/users/@me
* The Header Set For This Request, Is Obviously Your User Token, Meaning VirusTotal Will Attempt To Keep You Safe, Ultimately Deeming Radium As Well: Not Safe
* If You Have Any Serious Doubts, Please Do Not Bother To Use Radium: Nuking Community Is Already Dead, This Project Was Just Purely For Fun: Token Logging It Pointless And Waste Of Time, Considering Token Scrapers Now Exist
